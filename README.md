# Predicting-Handwritten-Images-using-Modified-LeNet-
In this, I have build LeNet model from scratch on Mnist dataset. It was able to achieve high test accuracy of 99+%.
The model was used to predict images taken from mobile.
I have added comments wherever required and have shown Calculation for Trainable paramaters also.
